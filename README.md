# Introduction

In the context of industrial liquid waste treatment, there are companies in Brazil specialized in handling effluents, classified into the following categories:

- **Green Line** – Leachate from sanitary landfills.
- **Brown Line** – Effluents from septic tanks, grease traps, chemical drains, and other non-hazardous wastewaters.
- **Yellow Line** – Effluents containing heavy metals, acidic and alkaline substances, generated by metalworking, electroplating industries, and others.
- **Gray Line** – Effluents contaminated with oil, oil emulsions, and oil sludge, originating from chemical, petrochemical, and metal finishing industries, among others.

In the vast metropolis of São Paulo, several companies are dedicated to treating these effluents. An example is a company that offers solutions for the treatment of non-domestic effluents for both public and private clients, standing out for implementing advanced technologies in waste management and client communication.

# Problem Explanation

The company receives a wide range of industrial effluents, such as those mentioned above. In this specific case, the treatability of an effluent classified under the **Gray Line** was evaluated, corresponding to **oily sludge**. This waste comprises a mixture of sediments contaminated with oils, water, and chemicals, generated in various industrial processes such as petroleum processing, machinery cleaning, and activities in petrochemical industries.

During plant operations, a problem arose concerning the lack of clarity about which preliminary treatment to apply to this type of effluent. To address this challenge, filtration tests were conducted using laboratory-scale fabrics. The objective of these tests was to determine whether it was possible to remove the solids present in the oily sludge and to evaluate if this process could be effectively implemented within the plant’s complete treatment system.
